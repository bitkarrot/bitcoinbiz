# TODO

- move the metadata description out of the react code into the bitcoinlinks.csv
- fetch this data directly from csv
- fetch tags from csv and add it to each card, OR if too many tag each card with a colored circle, and provide a legend or drop down to filter by tag

- auto grab the csv file from the nostrforms and make it auto pull request on github
- admins must be able to curate and edit results before merging, this is the easiest way without having to build more code.
